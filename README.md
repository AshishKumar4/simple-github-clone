## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) installed on your machine.
-   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
-   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed and configured.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vertex.git
    cd vertex
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Configure Cloudflare Wrangler:**
    Rename `wrangler.jsonc.example` to `wrangler.jsonc` and fill in your Cloudflare account details. You may also need to create a `.dev.vars` file for local development secrets if the project requires them.

### Running Locally

To start the development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Wrangler backend, run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Scripts

This project comes with several scripts to help with development:

-   `bun run dev`: Starts the local development server with hot-reloading.
-   `bun run build`: Builds the frontend application for production.
-   `bun run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint to check for errors and code style issues.
-   `bun run deploy`: Builds and deploys the application to your Cloudflare account.

## ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (Deployment)

This project is designed for seamless deployment to the Cloudflare network.

To deploy your application, simply run the deploy script:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

This command will build the Vite application and deploy it along with the worker using the Wrangler CLI.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository using the button below.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The codebase is organized into two main parts:

-   `src/`: Contains the entire React frontend application, including pages, components, hooks, and state management logic.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code, including the Hono API router, Durable Object definitions, and types.
